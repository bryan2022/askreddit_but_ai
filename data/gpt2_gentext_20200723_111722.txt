By Sara Goldberg

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Students who had been suspended for using a gay slur in 2011 should be allowed back into school this academic year, according to a U.S. senator who is Jewish.

Texas Republican Johnny Isakson said on Wednesday he would introduce a bill to ban federal funds from paying for sex education classes for two years.

"You cannot have one culture and one religion," Isakson told the WallBuilders of Kentucky City, Kentucky. "You can't mix them."

Isakson is the son of late U.S. Vice President Dan Rather and late U.S. Senator Joe Froman.

Isakson wrote in a blog post that he and his two brothers had "something special" for Dad when he passed away from lung cancer.

Senator Mark Kirk ofIllinois, who has been a staunch Trump supporter throughout his presidency, wrote on Facebook that while Trump has demonstrated "great leadership"

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who binge drink, smoke pot, or do both are more likely to have a child out of wedlock, a new study suggests.

Researchers analyzed information on nearly 11,000 adults in Sweden over a 14-year period. They found that men who had been sexually abused as children were more likely to be in abusive relationships as adults, while women with similar experiences were more likely to be in stable relationships.
