KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A man was killed and a woman was critically injured when a car driven by a group of men attacked them in Kansas City, police said.

Police say the victims were walking to a friends house for a friend's funeral.

Police were called to a domestic disturbance at around 2 a.m. Sunday after receiving a call about a male with a gun. When officers arrived they found the door to the home partially locked and a gun was pointed at them. The men inside told them they had been drinking and that they could leave when asked what was going to be done. When asked what was going to be done, one of the men said, "We'll find out one day."
